# Margaritas API
# Project Overview
The aim of this project was to create an API that could be connected to a frontend application and deployed using the Google Cloud Platform. I chose the theme of the cocktail margaritas, as there an infinite number of margarita recipes online that could be added and saved to the database.

This was created using the following tech stack:
<li>Java
  <li>Spring Boot
    <li>Maven
      <li>MySQL
          <li>Postman
              <li>Google Cloud Platform
                
<br>                
                <br>
             ** Unfortunately, my free credits on GCP have now ran out so I am in the process of deploying this on another cloud platform in order to complete the frontend of this full-stack application with React.
